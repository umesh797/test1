	<p>Explanation: In git if you have a remote you are dealing with 2 distinct repositories (local and remote). After you do git checkout staging, you actually create a distinct local name that represents the remote branch. git revert actually doesn't delete your commit, but it creates a new commit on top, that undoes all the changes (if you added a file - the new commit will remove it, if you removed a line - the new commit will add it back etc.), i.e. it is an addition to the log, that's why the push will be clean.

If you want to really make it gone, so that nobody can blame you, you can do at your risk:</p>
